<h3>What's Bitcamp?</h3>
<div class = "padded-content">
<br>Bitcamp is a place for exploration. We’re a hackathon that values participant experience and mentorship over competitiveness and points. Come to have fun with your friends, learn something new, eat s’mores, and have a generally awesome time. We have all sorts of crazy activities planned for you...you’ll have to come to find out the rest!
<br><br><h3>What’s a hackathon?</h3>
<br>A hackathon is a creative coding marathon. Students are encouraged to come with an idea, form teams, and then build out that idea into a product in 36 hours. For Bitcamp, we want you to take something you love (sports! art! camping!) and combine it with technology to make something awesome. It is a great time to push the envelope and learn some new skills.
<br><br><h3>Where’s Bitcamp?</h3>
    <br>On the campus of University of Maryland, College Park, exact location TBD.
<br><br><h3>Travel </h3>
<br>We’ll have buses covering travel from several schools and areas. Please contact <a href="mailto: travel@bitca.mp">travel@bitca.mp </a> for more information.
<br><br><h3>Guidelines</h3>
<br>Don’t bring any firearms, knives, weapons, drugs or alcohol. 
<br><br>Don’t use an old project. Start something new instead!
<br><br>Please read our Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody. (TL;DR: Be nice.)
<!--<br><br><h3>Timing </h3>
<br>TBD-->
<br><br><h3>Packing List </h3>
<br>Bring yourself, a photo ID, your signed waiver (if applicable), clothes, toiletries, a sleeping bag/blanket, your hacker setup and maybe an idea or two.
<br><br><h3>Registration Process</h3>
<br>Registration is TBA. When available, answer the questions regarding yourself, and later we will follow up with you with travel reimbursements, liability waivers, and the sort.
<br><br><h3>Teams</h3>
<br>Projects are submitted by teams to DevPost. You don’t need to finalize your team until project submissions are due during the event. Teams are limited to four people. You may have a one-person team.
<br><br><h3>Experience + Ideas </h3>
<br>Don’t be afraid if you don’t think you have enough experience, a team or an idea. A hackathon is meant for learning. We are going to have experienced mentors to help your team with a range of topics, and workshops on all kinds of skills.
<br><br><h3>Can I volunteer/mentor?</h3>
<br>We would love your help in guiding our hackers! <br /><a href ="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10-3ouNI4JCAH6n7WyTm_lXV50rEiGBnmlVznMf1Ody8/viewform?c=0&w=1"> Sign up to be a Volunteer </a> <br/><a href = "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1bMBfOt550apuLShodq8HCazFwYAaxb1MrvdA3-kBVIE/viewform?c=0&w=1"> Sign up to be a Mentor</a>
